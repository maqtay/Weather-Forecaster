# Weather-Forecaster

Hello to everyone. I am presenting this android application that I made using **clean architecture** as open source. Thanks to this application, users will be able to see 24-hour weather information of a desired location.
The technologies and Design Patterns I used while developing this application are:
- Clean Architecture
- MVVM
- Retrofit
- Dagger/Hilt
- Room
- Picasso
- Shared Preference
- Navigation Component
- Firebase Services

and more technologies.

### Here you can find some screenshots of the application.
